# Internship Reflection

This file is intended for your end‑of‑internship reflection. Use it to capture your thoughts on the overall experience, what you learned and how you plan to grow next.

## Suggested Prompts

Consider addressing the following questions:

- **What were your biggest achievements?** Describe the projects or tasks you completed and the skills you developed.
- **What challenges did you face?** Reflect on obstacles and how you overcame them. What would you do differently next time?
- **How did the tools and workflows support your work?** Comment on GitHub, Copilot, Figma, Playwright and other tools used during the internship.
- **What feedback did you receive and how did you apply it?** Summarise constructive feedback and how it improved your work.
- **What are your goals going forward?** Identify areas for further learning and how you plan to apply your new skills.

## Structure

Write in Markdown using headings and bullet points where appropriate. The reflection should be candid and introspective; it will not be graded but helps both you and the team improve the onboarding process.
