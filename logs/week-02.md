# Week 02 Log

Record your activities, time spent and observations for the second week of the internship. Follow the same structure as Week 01.

## Weekly Summary (to be filled at end of week)

I knew how to use Ai in the general sense but before this week honestly to code with it was a mission and I would have rather typed everything as the use cases I was attempting in my past where vauge and non descriptive and I did not know how to use it like a tool. Now I feel confident that I can do more with Ai in coding and that I do not have to hide my work out of embarrasment.

My pride was a bloker this week in not leaning into Ai more as I felt I was doing an injustice to my intelectual capacity however I have more time to do my courses now so I am thankful for that.

My understanding of codespaces is now more broad and I a have now met with the capabilities of MCP I have Learnt about containers and how they work a bit still not too confident yet but the basics are there. I am growing in my confidence In what Workflows are and what they do.
