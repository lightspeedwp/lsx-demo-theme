# Week 01 Log

Use this file to document your progress during the first week of the internship. Each day should have its own section with the date, hours logged, task, description and next steps. At the end of the week, provide a brief summary of what you accomplished.

## Weekly Summary (to be filled at end of week)
This first week focused on onboarding and setup across the team's core tools, getting familiar with the LSX Demo Theme repository, and beginning foundational project work. I completed account and profile setup (GitHub, Harvest, Asana, Loom, FireFlies, LinkedIn), installed recommended extensions, updated repository documentation, and started reviewing Full Site Editing concepts and the theme structure. Next week I'll begin making small, focused contributions to patterns and templates and continue practising Git workflows and time tracking.
