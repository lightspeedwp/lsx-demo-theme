# LightSpeed Saved Replies

In order to help reduce the time it takes to respond to open Issues and Pull Requests, we should leverage [GitHub’s Saved Replies](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-saved-replies) to help when we are continually responding in the same manner.  The following are various Saved Replies that the LightSpeed team should use to respond to Issues and Pull Requests to ensure our community responses are similar and to minimize the amount of time crafting the same response to different requests.

Since GitHub currently does not allow us to have a repository-wide or organization-wide list of [saved replies](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-saved-replies/), these replies need to be maintained by individual team members.  Since the replies can be modified in the future, all responses are versioned to simplify the process of keeping the replies up to date.

While these Saved Replies attempt to give you the ability to quickly reply to Issues and Pull Requests, they are not meant to be the _exact_ response you should use every time.  Consider customizing them to fit the context of the Issue or Pull Request contribution you are replying to.  You will be best served by welcoming the contributor to the project (if its their first issue/PR), thanking them for their contribution, giving them context to your response (especially if you're closing their issue/PR), and noting next steps (e.g., issue milestoned for a specific release, open to them submitting a PR to resolve an issue, sending a PR to someone else to review).

You can add these saved replies to [your personal GitHub account here](https://github.com/settings/replies).

## Getting Started: contributing workflow (v1)
```
Thank you for your interest in contributing to LightSpeed! Our ideal workflow is:

1. Start with a GitHub Issue using the appropriate template.
2. Create a descriptive branch (e.g., feature/short-description).
3. Develop your solution, following our code style and standards.
4. Open a Pull Request (PR) to the correct base branch (e.g., trunk or trunk 2.1), linking to the related issue and including test instructions and screenshots if applicable.
5. Address review feedback and ensure all checks pass before merging.

For more details, see our [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
```

## PR: converted to draft (v1)
```
Thank you for your PR! It does not yet meet all our contribution requirements (see the checklist in CONTRIBUTING.md), so it has been converted to a draft. Please update your PR to address the outstanding items, then mark it as ready for review.
```

## PR: CI/CD failure (v1)
```
Thank you for your contribution! One or more automated checks (CI/CD) have failed. Please review the errors, update your code as needed, and push the changes to your branch. All checks must pass before your PR can be merged.
```

## PR: branch naming (v1)
```
Thank you for your PR! For clarity and consistency, please use a descriptive branch name such as `feature/short-description`, `bugfix/short-description`, or `chore/short-description`. If needed, you can rename your branch and update the PR.
```

## PR: missing related Issue (v1)
```
Thanks for filing this PR!  Please note that we require an Issue for each PR so that approach and other details can be discussed in the Issue while code review can happen in the PR.  I would appreciate it if you could [open an Issue](https://github.com/lightspeedwp/REPONAME/issues/new/choose) and link it to this PR for further discussion.
