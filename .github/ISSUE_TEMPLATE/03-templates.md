Use this issue to capture work on fullâ€‘page templates (e.g. `index.html`, `404.html`).

## Acceptance criteria

List the conditions that must be met for the template to be considered complete. For example:

- [ ] All required blocks are present and in the correct order.
- [ ] Responsive behaviour matches the design brief.
- [ ] Styles are defined in `theme.json` rather than inline CSS.
- [ ] Accessibility considerations (semantic HTML, alt text, heading hierarchy) are addressed.

## Included template parts

Enumerate the reusable template parts (e.g. header, footer, sidebar) that this template uses. Reference any existing issues for those parts or create new ones if needed.

## Notes

Provide additional context, references or questions about the template. Include links to designs, patterns or curriculum sections.
