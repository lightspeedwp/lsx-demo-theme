-   ❌ Needs Work — Needs continuous intervention or has not demonstrated the skill yet

Mentors complete scoring at the end of each month and discuss results during 1:1 reviews. Evidence for scoring comes from planning files, logs, issues, PRs, GitHub project board, code, design handoffs, and overall workflow consistency.
