## Evaluation Alignment & Additional Notes

-   This rubric references the complete intern journey: block themes, plugin development, Figma/MCP, testing, production contributions, and communication/workflow.
-   Success is measured by clear outputs: code, design, project management, team fit, and learning growth.
-   Each category maps to curriculum phases and project deliverables.
-   Use logs, planning, reflections, project boards, PR reviews, and Figma files as evidence during evaluation.
-   Mentors should cross-reference intern work (logs, PRs, project boards, Figma files) with deliverables and checklist items monthly.

This scoring guide is authoritative for all intern evaluations at LightSpeed and ensures alignment between the curriculum, client-ready outcomes, and mentoring standards.
