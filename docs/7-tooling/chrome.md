## Extension List Review & Internship Alignment

-   AI-powered, accessibility-focused, productivity, design, content, and download management extensions are covered.

## Usage Tips

-   Pin only what you need: Too many extensions slow your browser. Pin essentials (1Password, BugHerd, Fireflies) and keep others in the puzzle menu.
-   Review permissions: Only install trusted extensions listed here. Double-check permissions (“read and change all website data”) before accepting.
-   Update regularly: Chrome auto-updates, but you can force updates at chrome://extensions.
-   Desktop only: Chrome extensions do not work on mobile browsers. For mobile access, install the equivalent apps (see Mobile Apps Guide).

By following this checklist, you ensure your browser is optimally equipped for agency-ready WordPress and web development at LightSpeed.
