## 1. Weekly Planning

When:

-   Create your plan every Friday before you clock out.
-   Review the plan again on Monday morning.

How to Plan Your Week:

1. Review Logs & Last Week’s Effort

    - Skim your daily logs and last week’s reflection.
    - Note wins, incomplete tasks, blockers, and confusion points.

2. Set 2–4 Weekly Goals

    - Goals should be deliverable-based or learning-based.
    - Examples:
        - Complete homepage layout in the Site Editor
        - Finish plugin CPT + meta fields
        - Write documentation for theme.json
        - Review Git branching and PR best practices

3. Break Goals into Daily Tasks

    - Assign tasks to each weekday.
    - Example plan:
        - Monday — Build header in Site Editor, set up branch
        - Tuesday — Configure theme.json colors, plugin setup
        - Wednesday — Block development, pattern registration
        - Thursday — QA + cleanup
        - Friday — Reflection, next-week planning

4. Predict Blockers

    - Write down potential issues and mitigation approaches.

5. Share Your Plan
    - Save the plan to GitHub in your weekly logs folder.
    - Link the file in Asana inside the “Weekly Planning” task.

## 2. Daily Planning & Task Management

-   Each morning, open your planning file and copy your tasks into that day’s log.
-   Use markdown checklists or time-blocking to structure your day.
-   Update your progress every few hours.
-   Call out blockers immediately and document attempts to resolve them.

Daily Log Template

-   Use files in this format: logs/weekNN/logs-weekNN-dayX.md
-   Example folder: https://github.com/lightspeedwp/lsx-demo-theme/tree/main/logs/weekXX/logs-weekXX-dayX.md

Suggested daily log sections:

-   Date
-   Morning plan (copy tasks from weekly plan)
-   Time blocks / task checklist
-   Blockers & Help Needed
-   End-of-day summary / outcomes
-   Links to branches / PRs / issues

---

## 3. Tracking Progress & Adjustments

-   Update your daily log throughout the day.
-   At the end of the week, compare planned work vs completed work.
-   If you missed something:
    -   Identify why.
    -   Plan how you’ll avoid the same issue next week.
-   Reflection is part of the skill-building cycle.

---

## 4. Reporting & Integration

You’ll interact with three tools:

-   GitHub

    -   All logs and planning files must be committed here.
    -   Mentors use these to review your work habits and progress.

-   Asana

    -   Links to your GitHub planning files go in the Weekly Planning task.
    -   Keeps plans visible to the whole team.

-   Slack
    -   Used during stand-ups to confirm what you're working on.
    -   Reference your daily log or planning file when needed.

| Monday   | Review plan and set up your daily tasks  |
