## Quickstart Overview

Purpose: Central hub to manage internship planning, progress logs, and reflections.
Systems Used: GitHub (logs, planning, reflections), Asana (task tracking), Slack (communication).
Outcome: Consistent, visible record of skill growth for review and portfolio.

---

## 1. Weekly Planning

How to Plan:

-   Reflect on last week: review progress, identify blockers and wins.
-   Set achievable goals: list 2–4 clear weekly goals (skills, deliverables).
-   Break into daily tasks: assign key tasks to each day.
-   Align with mentor: share plans for feedback via Asana and stand-up.

Frequency:

-   Every Friday before clocking out.

Workflow:

-   Draft plan in GitHub: logs/weekNN/logs-weekNN-planning.md
-   Reference the planning template:
    https://github.com/lightspeedwp/lsx-demo-theme/blob/main/logs/weekXX/logs-weekXX-planning.md
-   Push your plan to GitHub.
-   Add the GitHub link as a comment in the Asana Weekly Planning task.

Template Example

-   # Week 13 Planning (YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD)
    -   Weekly Goals, Key Tasks (by day), Learning Goals, Technical Skills, Collaboration & Communication, Success Metrics

## 2. Reflections & Retrospectives

Purpose:

-   Step back, review what went well, what can improve, and consolidate learning.

Process:

-   Spend 30–45 minutes every Friday writing your Weekly Reflection.
-   Answer:
    -   What did I learn?
    -   What went well?
    -   What can I improve?
    -   What’s next?
-   Link your reflection in Asana for mentor review.
-   Frequency: Weekly (Friday); bi-weekly summary for cohort retro via Slack.

Workflow:

-   Use the reflection template:
    https://github.com/lightspeedwp/lsx-demo-theme/blob/main/logs/weekXX/logs-weekXX-reflections.md
-   Create/complete: logs/weekNN/logs-weekNN-reflections.md
-   Push to GitHub and post the link in Asana.

Template Example

-   # Week 13 Reflection
    -   Courses, What Went Well, What Can Be Improved, What Have You Learned, Next Actions

## 3. Daily Logs

Purpose:

-   Daily journal of work completed, hours tracked, challenges and wins, and blockers.

How to Log:

-   Open your log file at the start of each day: logs/weekNN/logs-weekNN-dayX.md
-   Update every 2–3 hours.
-   End of day: finalize, ensure Harvest hours match, and push to GitHub.

Frequency:

-   Every workday (Monday–Friday).

Workflow:

-   Use the daily log template:
    https://github.com/lightspeedwp/lsx-demo-theme/tree/main/logs/weekXX/logs-weekXX-dayX.md
-   Create each daily log in the correct weekNN/ folder.
-   Post the GitHub link as a comment in the Asana Logs task.

Template Example

-   # Week NN, Day X Log
    -   Date, Today's Progress, How do you feel about today's progress?, Time Logs, Notes

## 4. Asana Integration

Updating Tasks:

-   You will update three main tasks: Logs, Weekly Planning, Weekly Reflections.
-   Do NOT create subtasks for days/weeks.
-   All links are added as comments on the same task.

-   Tag mentors if you need help or have blockers.

Best Practices:

-   Keep comments short but clear.
-   Always add GitHub links after pushing updates.
-   Mention blockers early so mentors can help ASAP.
