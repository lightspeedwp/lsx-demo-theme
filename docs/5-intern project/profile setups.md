# LightSpeed Intern Profiles & Accounts Guide

A complete onboarding reference for creating, configuring and maintaining your professional profiles.

---

## 1. Purpose of This Guide

As a LightSpeed intern, you will use a shared set of professional tools—some for internal work, others to build your public identity in the WordPress and open-web ecosystem.

This guide explains:

-   Why these profiles matter.
-   Global rules for usernames, photos, security, consistency, and professionalism.
-   How to sign up for each service in the correct order.
-   How to fill in your bios and profile fields.
-   Extra emphasis on Figma, which is one of your most important public profiles.
-   A full registration table with links to every signup page.
-   A FAQ section addressing common issues.

When complete, your online footprint should be: **consistent, professional, secure, and interconnected**.

---

## 2. Global Profile Standards

These rules apply to every platform.

### 2.1 Username Format

-   Use a consistent format across all services:
    `namesurname` in lowercase
-   No numbers, hyphens or special characters unless absolutely unavoidable.
-   If your ideal username is taken, choose the cleanest variation:
    `namesurname1` or `nameinitialsurname`.
-   For public profiles, this is how people will find you—keep it simple and unified.

### 2.2 Display Names

-   Display names may use capitals on platforms that allow it (Slack, Asana, Loom).
-   Use your real full name or first name only where instructed.

### 2.3 Profile Photo

Upload one professional headshot everywhere:

-   Neutral background
-   Good lighting
-   No filters or heavy edits
-   No avatars, anime, cartoons or logos
-   No selfies or casual photos

This creates a unified professional identity across all tools.

### 2.4 Login & Security

-   Always use your LightSpeed Google account when available.
-   Store every login in 1Password, including backup codes.
-   Enable 2FA and passkeys where supported.
-   Before reusing your email on a new service, check it on:
    https://haveibeenpwned.com/
-   Never store passwords in browsers or text files.

### 2.5 Public Facing Profile Fields

On LinkedIn, GitHub, Figma and WordPress.org:

-   **Role:** “WordPress Block Theme Developer Intern at LightSpeed”
-   **Skills:** WordPress, WooCommerce, Block Themes, GitHub, Figma, GitHub Copilot, Design Systems, AI-assisted development.
-   **Links:** Add links to your GitHub, Figma, WordPress.org and LinkedIn.
-   No nicknames or non-professional language.

---

## 3. Priority Profiles (Order of Setup)

Follow these steps in order. Early steps unlock later ones.

### 3.1 Step 1 — Security & Time Tracking

**1Password**
The first account you create.
Used for storing:

-   All passwords
-   Backup codes
-   Passkeys
-   Secure notes

**Harvest**
Start tracking:

-   Study time
-   Project time
-   Meetings
-   Tutorials

Include short but clear descriptions.

### 3.2 Step 2 — LightSpeed Internal Access

**Google Account**
Your LightSpeed Google account is your primary identity.

-   Add your photo and sync Gmail, Drive, Calendar and Docs.

**Slack**
Internal communication platform.

-   Display name: First name
-   Title: Intern – WordPress Block Themes

**Asana**
Task tracking and daily workflow.

-   Display name: First name only

### 3.3 Step 3 — Professional Public Profiles

These profiles represent you publicly.

**LinkedIn**
Your long-term career profile.

-   Clean the URL and complete your About, Experience and Skills.

### 3.4 Step 4 — GitHub

Your developer identity.

-   Username must be consistent: `namesurname`
-   Pin your first repo and create a neat profile README.

---

## 4. Figma — A Core Profile (Expanded)

Figma is one of the most important profiles in your onboarding because:

-   It becomes your public design portfolio.
-   You will create a Figma file, publish it (or set it to view-only), and have it appear on your public profile.
-   The quality of your Figma profile reflects your understanding of design systems, UX decisions and block theme principles.

**Figma Profile Requirements**

Your Figma profile must include:

-   Profile photo (same as all others)
-   Real full name
-   Username matching GitHub: `namesurname`
-   Bio (short, professional):
    “WordPress Block Theme Developer Intern at LightSpeed. Learning design systems, Figma variables and WordPress block theme UX.”
-   Location
-   Links:
    -   GitHub
    -   LinkedIn
    -   WordPress.org

**Figma Work Requirement (important!)**

Each intern will:

-   Create at least one Figma design file (example: “Homepage Wireframe”, “Component Library Demo”, “Block Theme Layout Exercise”)
-   Publish it to their public Figma profile
    (free accounts can publish only a limited number of files — you must choose your best one)

This ensures every intern has a real portfolio piece during (and after) the internship.

---

## 5. WordPress Ecosystem Profiles

You must complete:

-   **WordPress.com** → used for login and Gravatar
-   **Gravatar** → sets your global avatar
-   **WordPress.org** → your official contributor identity
-   **WordPress Slack** → WordPress community chat
-   **Learn.WordPress.org** → your course achievements appear on your WP.org profile

These profiles are essential for anyone building a career in WordPress.

-   Fireflies.ai
-   Loom
-   BugHerd
-   Stark

Interns should complete:

-   **Task 1 — Create a small design file**
    Examples:

    -   Homepage wireframe
    -   Component set (buttons, cards, forms)
    -   Typography & colour token demo
    -   Block theme layout mockup

-   **Task 2 — Publish it to your public Figma profile**
    This becomes your first portfolio item and will be used in your end-of-internship review.

## 9. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q1: What if my namesurname handle is taken?**

-   Choose the cleanest possible variation, such as: `namesurname1`, `nameinitialsurname`, `namesurname_` (only if absolutely required).
-   Keep the variation consistent across GitHub, Figma and WordPress.org.

**Q2: My WordPress.org account hasn’t been approved yet — what should I do?**

-   Approval sometimes takes 24–48 hours.
-   Make sure your Gravatar profile is fully completed, as incomplete profiles cause delays.

**Q3: How many Figma files can I publish on a free account?**

-   Free plans allow a limited number of published files.
-   You must select one strong portfolio example to publish publicly.

**Q4: I created a Figma file but it’s not showing on my profile. Why?**

-   You need to publish the file (not just create it).
-   Go to File → Publish to Community.

**Q5: What do I do if a platform doesn’t support Google login?**

-   Use your LightSpeed email, create a password in 1Password, and enable 2FA.

**Q6: Should I create these accounts using my personal email?**

-   No — use your LightSpeed Google account unless a service does not allow it.

**Q7: How do I stay consistent across so many profiles?**

-   Use the same: photo, bio structure, username, links.
-   Your goal is a cohesive professional identity.

**Q8: What if I make a mistake during signup?**

-   Most platforms allow:
    -   Changing your handle
    -   Updating your photo
    -   Fixing typos in your name
    -   Updating bios and links
-   If you get stuck, ask for help before creating a duplicate account.

**Q9: Why do I need a YouTube account?**

-   To curate a professional learning feed, subscribe to:
    -   WordPress channels
    -   Figma
    -   GitHub
    -   OpenAI
    -   VS Code / Dev channels
-   This becomes part of your learning environment.

**Q10: Why is Figma treated as a core portfolio?**

-   Because:
    -   It’s your first design portfolio item during the internship.
    -   It will appear on your public profile.
    -   Recruiters often check your Figma work before GitHub.
    -   It demonstrates your understanding of:
        -   Components
        -   Variables
        -   UX
        -   Block theme layout principles
