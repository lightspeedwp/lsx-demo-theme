# Block Theme & Plugin Developer Internship

Location: Remote
Type: Internship → Full-Time Employee
Hours: 40 hours/week
Team: LightSpeed WordPress Agency

---

## Overview

This six-month internship is purpose-built to align with the updated Developer Study Curriculum. You’ll advance from junior frontend developer to production-ready WordPress block theme and plugin specialist, working through real client-style projects and progressing toward full-time employment. Training blends structured study, hands-on assignments, daily GitHub workflows, and ongoing mentorship.

The programme is unique in connecting development and design workflows: in the final phase, you’ll gain Figma skills, build design system awareness, and use Figma MCP to streamline the code-to-design pipeline—aligning patterns, variables, and components as part of modern block theme development.

## What You’ll Learn

Across the six months, you’ll master:

-   Core WordPress block theme development (theme.json, templates, global styles, patterns)
-   Figma essentials: components, variables, and design system best practices
-   Mapping design tokens and Figma variables into theme.json for WordPress
-   Scaffolding code in VS Code using Figma MCP server integration
-   Creating and managing custom post types, taxonomies, custom fields, and relationships
-   Developing your own plugin for structured content management
-   Building custom Gutenberg blocks and templates for single/archive content
-   Daily and weekly GitHub workflows: issues, branches, PRs, code reviews, documentation
-   Using Copilot and Studio-based WordPress environments for productive local dev
-   QA basics: responsive testing, accessibility awareness, and checklists
-   Planning, daily logs, weekly reflections, and async communication
-   Taking on paid work as a junior contributor from Month 4 onward

## How the Programme Works (Month-by-Month)

### Months 1–2: Foundations

-   Set up your dev environment, tools, and profiles (GitHub, WP.org, Learn WordPress, Figma, Microsoft Learn, Ollie Academy)
-   Focus on block theme fundamentals, theme.json, global styles, and initial block/pattern experimentation
-   Daily async workflow: commits, logs, PR reviews, and documentation

### Months 3–4: Applied Development

-   Build a custom plugin, model structured content (CPTs, taxonomies, fields), and develop a custom Gutenberg block
-   Structure single/archive templates, join team code reviews, scrums, and async retros
-   Begin contributing to production tasks and your paid internship phase

### Months 5–6: Design Systems & MCP Integration

-   Complete Figma beginner and intermediate courses; learn core design system principles (tokens, grids, component libraries)
-   Map Figma tokens to theme.json and connect Figma files to your codebase via MCP
-   Prompt starter code for themes and blocks directly from VS Code, publish variations to Figma Community
-   Refine your custom plugin and documentation for production readiness
-   Graduate ready to interpret professional design systems, align code with design standards, and build scalable, consistent WordPress experiences

---

## How Development & Design Connect

In the final phase, you’ll learn how to:

-   Map Figma variables and components to theme.json and WordPress block patterns
-   Use MCP integration to jump between Figma and VS Code, prompting code and design assets from a single source of truth
-   Apply design rules for consistent layout and spacing in block themes
-   Scaffold starter code that matches agency design systems
-   Reduce friction between design and development, bringing true design-to-code pipelines to client projects

---

## What Success Looks Like

By the end of the internship, you’ll be able to:

-   Build and customize block themes from scratch
-   Create, structure, and document your own plugin for custom content/workflows
-   Model complex content with custom post types, taxonomies, relationships, and custom fields
-   Develop and document functional Gutenberg blocks
-   Work confidently with modern design systems (Figma, MCP)
-   Submit clean, reviewed PRs in GitHub, following async team workflows
-   Collaborate fluently in a remote WordPress agency
-   Transition into a full-time developer role, with ongoing growth and mentoring

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How long is the internship?
A: Six months (24 weeks). The first half covers technical and block theme fundamentals; the second half moves into design systems, Figma, and advanced code–design integrations.

Q: Is this internship full-time?
A: Yes — 40 hours per week following LightSpeed’s async, remote agency workflow.

Q: When do we learn Figma and design systems?
A: Figma and design system work start in Month 5, with guided curriculum, Figma.com courses, and MCP integration projects.

Q: What is Figma MCP and why do we use it?
A: Figma MCP (“Model–Code–Prompt”) enables you to bridge design and code, generating code directly from design context. It helps keep theme.json and block patterns matched with active design decisions.

Q: Will I work on a specific project?
A: Yes — each intern works on a unique plugin, block, and template set, ensuring agency-ready skills and avoiding dependencies on other interns.

Q: How is progress tracked?
A: Daily logs, weekly reflections, project milestones, GitHub issues and PRs, and async check-ins. You’ll also have regular mentor feedback.

Q: When do I start getting paid?
A: At Month 4, once you reach junior-level competency and begin contributing production-quality work.

Q: Do I need to buy any software?
A: No — all required tools (WordPress Studio, VS Code, Figma, etc.) are free or provided.

Q: Will I be hired full-time after the internship?
A: Full-time offers are made to interns who demonstrate required competencies: technical mastery, communication, reliability, and ownership.

Q: How are development and design integrated?
A: You’ll learn code–design mapping using MCP and Figma, aligning blocks, patterns, and theme.json directly with design assets and design rules for a modern workflow.
